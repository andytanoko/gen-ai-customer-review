# 🧠 Generative AI for Customer Reviews: Aspect-Based Classification and Summarization

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores the use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to automate **Aspect-Based Sentiment Classification** and **Summarization** of customer reviews in e-commerce and digital service platforms. By applying generative AI, the solution provides businesses with deeper, more actionable insights into customer feedback, enabling smarter product and service improvements.

## 🏢 Business Context

In today’s digital marketplace, **customer reviews** are a cornerstone of consumer decision-making and brand perception. Businesses rely on these reviews to:

- Measure **customer satisfaction**
- Identify **pain points** in products or services
- Drive **continuous improvement** and **product innovation**

However, the vast volume and unstructured nature of customer feedback pose challenges for timely and meaningful analysis.

### 🔍 Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis

This project employs **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** to understand sentiments associated with specific aspects of a product or service (e.g., screen quality, delivery experience, support response). This **fine-grained analysis** allows businesses to:

- Identify **targeted issues**
- Track sentiment trends over time
- Improve **specific product features** or service areas

### 🤖 Generative AI for Summarization

The introduction of **LLMs** has transformed the landscape for processing natural language at scale. In this project, we leverage LLMs to:

- **Summarize reviews and support cases** concisely
- Provide **overview insights** on customer sentiment
- Reduce manual analysis time and increase response efficiency

### 🎯 Model Fine-Tuning

To enhance the relevance and accuracy of LLM-generated summaries, we include a module for **domain-specific fine-tuning**. This enables the model to better capture industry-specific terminology and sentiment nuance, further improving summarization quality.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The key goals of this project are:

- ✅ Classify the **overall sentiment** of customer reviews (Positive, Neutral, Negative)
- ✅ Perform **Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)** on key review components
- ✅ Generate **natural language summaries** of individual or aggregated reviews
- ✅ Evaluate LLM performance using standard metrics (e.g., ROUGE, BLEU, accuracy)
